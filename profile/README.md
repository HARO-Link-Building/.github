# How to Leverage HARO for Authoritative Link Building

Earning high-quality backlinks is still probably one of the very few pillars of achieving good SEO. Generally, HARO can prove an effective way to get authoritative links, although it remains largely underused. Established in 2008 to link journalists and subject matter experts, it gives you an opportunity to provide useful insights in exchange for a backlink from esteemed publications.

Now we will discuss how to use HARO for link building effectively, why all SEO professionals love using it, and what to do to have the best chance of being picked up by reputable media outlets.

## Why HARO Backlinks Are So Valuable

These backlinks are highly respected in the SEO community since they are placed within editorials and are not offered through any payment or through link exchanges. When a journalist places your quote in a story, they essentially link you back naturally, and such backlinks are considered highly valuable by search engines.

Here’s what makes them stand out:

- **High Domain Authority Sources**: HARO links usually arise from publications with Domain Authority (DA) of 70 or above, such as Forbes, Reuters, or TechCrunch. Consequently, these backlinks will weigh more on your rankings.
- **Purely White-Hat**: Since you provide real insights and get editorially featured, such links are compliant with Google and are completely safe to use, unlike paid or manipulative link schemes.
- **Establishes a Strong E-E-A-T**: Being quoted by reputable sites endorses your brand’s Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness, which are the signals that Google uses in evaluating content quality.

## How to Use HARO to Build Backlinks

A proper system is needed to get real results with HARO, not merely excitement. Below is a step-by-step process describing setting up, choosing opportunities, drafting winning pitches, and effectively tracking results.

### 1. Create a Professional HARO Profile

Your relationship with HARO actually begins with your profile. This is the first impression that is cast both upon HARO and onto the journalists that read your answers. A good profile should create credibility and professionalism so that journalists in turn may trust the information you present.

**What to include:**

- **Real Name**: Always provide your real name or a fixed professional alias. Whose first name is used casually, journalists ought to know the person whom they are quoting.
- **Business Email**: Have an email address under your own or your own company's domain. For example, yourname@company.com. Free email domains like Gmail and Yahoo look expendable and may risk your profile not being taken seriously.
- **Credentials or Short Bio**: This brief statement should tell of your demonstrated abilities, one to two lines maximum. Ex.: "Content strategist with 8+ years of experience in digital marketing and SEO." This bio usually accompanies your pitch to give weight to your authority.
- **Professional Headshot**: If applicable, upload a neat and professional photo. It is not a must-have, but an effective way to humanize your profile and instill trust.
- **Website Link**: Your business or personal brand website must be linked. If chosen, this is usually where your backlink will be directed to.

### 2. Choose Relevant Queries

Not every HARO query is worth getting attention. You have to be selective and methodical in how you work with them. Respond only if that request corresponds with your expertise and business niche. The more you do so, the better the chances get to be featured, and the backlink generated gets extensively topical to your site.

**How to approach this step:**

- **Stick to Your Domain**: Stay with those topics you truly understand. In marketing? Unless you are truly legal in finance or healthcare, don't answer queries in those fields. Irrelevant pitches are a time-waster and damage your credibility.
- **Target Your Industry**: HARO queries are classified (Business, Health, Tech, Lifestyle, etc.). Subscribe only to categories relevant to your niche to get rid of noise.
- **Look for Journalistic Fit**: Many requests will specify where the article will be published (e.g., “Looking for marketing insights for a Forbes article”). If those matches are beneficial to your SEO goals, treat those as priorities.

### 3. Respond Quickly

Hence, timing is perhaps one of the most vital success factors on HARO. Journalists could receive hundreds of responses for a query and would even start to sift through pitches long before the deadline.

**Why does speed matter so much?**

- **First-mover advantage**: Journalists tend to select responses at once after finding good ones. Being one of the first to send over responses maximizes getting noticed before they actually finalize their list.
- **Query expiry**: Some opportunities close earlier than expected once the journalist has quickly found what he/she wants. The same thing could happen to your pitch if you delay submitting it—even when it is an excellent one.

**How to be fast:**

- **Emails**: Fresh HARO mails get dispatched thrice a day, i.e., morning, afternoon, and evening (EST). Set reminders, or create a filter to push those HARO mails to the top of your inbox.
- **Create Templates**: Pre-create pitch templates, which you can then swiftly customize. It saves you lots of time while keeping a tuned message.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Sometimes great opportunities arise when one is not at the desk. Forwarding HARO emails to your phone will help you respond at once.

### 4. Write a Winning Pitch

Writing the perfect pitch is where most users either succeed or fail. Journalists want value—fast. Making your pitch clear, to the point, relevant, and brief is essential. Avoid beating around the bush; try to make the journalist's job easier.

**The prime components that must be present in any good HARO pitch include:**

- **Personalized Greeting**: Use the journalist's name if given. A polite "Hi there" will suffice.
- **Brief Introduction**: State your name in one or two sentences and quickly explain how you are an expert on the topic.
- **Quote-Ready Response**: This is the core of your pitch, which will need to be an insightful, direct, and quotable statement.
- **Professional Bio**: Finish your pitch with a one-line bio to use for attribution if necessary, along with your job title and business name.
- **Website Link (if allowed)**: Be sure to give them your website or portfolio so they can properly credit you.

**Avoid These Mistakes:**

- Generic responses that don't speak to the specific issues  
- Overly verbose answers  
- Answers with more sales lingo or promotional vibe  
- Lack of structure (no coherent quote area)  

### 5. Track Your Submissions

Organization becomes essential as soon as one begins dispatching multiple pitches per week. Tracking allows you to know what types of queries perform best, keep an eye on your success rate, and stay on top of features that have been published.

**What to track:**

| Column             | Details                                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Date Submitted     | When you sent the pitch                         |
| Query Topic        | What the query was about                        |
| Journalist/Publication | Who you sent it to                        |
| Pitch Content      | A copy of the actual pitch                      |
| Status             | Submitted / Accepted / Rejected                 |
| Published URL      | Link to the live article (if featured)          |

**Tools to use:**

- **Google Sheets or Excel**: These options offer the simplicity and opportunity to build bespoke tracking columns.
- **Notion**: Designed for an editorial-type database with tags and filters.
- **Airtable**: More advanced implementations, like automation and collaboration, if working with a team.
